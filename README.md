MidnightCountdownJS
===================

This is a simple JavaScript timer, that counts down to a specific date/time. Super simple, the point of this was to give an easy snippet of code for someone who is less experienced in JavaScript, and use this for a timer on their site. Documentation within the file. Anyone should be able to figure this little widget out, and modify it if necessary. Fork away people!
